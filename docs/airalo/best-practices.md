# Airalo API - Best Practices

This document outlines recommended best practices for integrating with the Airalo Partner API.

## API Integration

### Authentication
- Store API credentials securely in environment variables
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Implement proper error handling for authentication failures

### Request Management
- Implement request retries with exponential backoff
- Cache responses where appropriate to reduce API calls
- Set appropriate timeouts for API requests

### Error Handling
- Log all API errors with sufficient context
- Implement graceful fallbacks for temporary API issues
- Display user-friendly error messages

## Order Flow

### Creating Orders
- Validate all input data before submitting orders
- Store the order ID and ICCID returned by the API
- Implement idempotency to prevent duplicate orders

### Managing Orders
- Regularly check order status for updates
- Handle status changes appropriately in your system
- Keep historical order data for troubleshooting

## eSIM Management

### Installation
- Provide clear installation instructions for different device types
- Store QR codes securely to prevent unauthorized access
- Test installation flows on various device models

### Data Usage
- Display remaining data and validity period clearly to users
- Send notifications before data packages expire
- Implement easy top-up workflows

## Testing

### Sandbox Environment
- Always test new integrations in the sandbox environment first
- Create test cases for all possible user flows
- Verify error handling works as expected

### Production Verification
- Test with small orders initially when moving to production
- Verify all notifications and webhooks are working
- Monitor initial production orders closely

## Performance

### Optimization
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Batch operations where possible
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data

### Monitoring
- Track API response times and error rates
- Set up alerts for unusual API behavior
- Monitor order completion rates

## Security

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper access controls
- Regularly rotate API credentials

### Compliance
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
- Follow Airalo's terms of service
- Document all data handling processes

## Updates and Maintenance

### API Changes
- Monitor Airalo's documentation for API updates
- Test changes in sandbox before applying to production
- Maintain flexibility in your code to handle new fields
